# Incubator-Hub-HR-Data-Analysis

## Project Title: HR DATA ANALYSIS

## Project Overview: 
This project uses Power BI to transform a comprehensive HR dataset into a visualised analysis of employee demographics, attritions, satisfaction levels, and performance metrics, offering an in-depth view into the organisation’s workforce dynamics. By examining patterns across job roles, departments, and age groups, it provides insights that can help HR Admins address key issues such as employee retention, engagement, and satisfaction. The interactive dashboard empowers decision-makers to identify factors driving turnover, understand the impact of work-life balance initiatives, and tailor HR strategies that foster a motivated, loyal, and productive workforce.

## Data Source
